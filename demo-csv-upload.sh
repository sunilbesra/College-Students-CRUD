echo "üöÄ Getting Started:"
echo "1. Start the development server:"
echo "   php artisan serve"
echo ""
echo "2. In a new terminal, start the unified student processing workers:"
echo "   ./start-student-workers.sh"
echo "   (or use the legacy CSV-only worker: ./start-csv-worker.sh)"
echo ""
echo "3. Open your browser and navigate to:"
echo "   http://localhost:8000"
echo ""
echo "4. Click 'Upload CSV' and upload the sample_students.csv file"
echo ""
echo "5. Monitor the processing progress on the upload page"
echo ""

echo "üìÑ Sample CSV Content:"
echo "The sample_students.csv file contains:"
head -6 sample_students.csv 2>/dev/null || echo "Sample CSV file not found. Please run this script from the project directory."

echo "- Form ‚Üí Beanstalkd ‚Üí Laravel Consumer ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí MongoDB"
echo "- CSV ‚Üí Beanstalkd ‚Üí Laravel Consumer ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí MongoDB"
echo "- Asynchronous processing using Beanstalkd queues"
echo "- Real-time progress monitoring for CSV uploads"
echo "- Individual validation and error handling"
echo "- Automatic retry on failures with exponential backoff"
echo "- Unified logging and error reporting"
echo "- External mirroring to Aurora/other consumers"
