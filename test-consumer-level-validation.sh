# Test Consumer-Level Duplicate Validation Architecture

echo "ðŸ“‹ Current architecture flow:"
echo "1. Form/CSV data submitted"
echo "2. Data queued to Beanstalk"
echo "3. Laravel Consumer (ProcessFormSubmissionData) processes queue"
echo "4. Consumer validates data (including duplicate email check)"
echo "5. If validation passes: Create FormSubmission record in MongoDB"
echo "6. If validation fails: Mark as failed, trigger DuplicateEmailDetected event"

echo "âœ… Architecture Verification:"
echo "- Model-level duplicate prevention: REMOVED (no longer in FormSubmission boot method)"
echo "- Consumer-level validation: ACTIVE (ProcessFormSubmissionData validates before creation)"
echo "- Duplicate detection: Handled by FormSubmissionValidator in consumer"
echo "- Failed submissions: Stored with 'failed' status for tracking"
echo "- Events: DuplicateEmailDetected triggered for analytics"

echo "ðŸŽ¯ Key Implementation Points:"
echo "- FormSubmission model no longer prevents duplicates at creation"
echo "- ProcessFormSubmissionData job validates data BEFORE creating FormSubmission"
echo "- Validation failures result in 'failed' status records"
echo "- Proper architectural flow: Controller â†’ Beanstalk â†’ Consumer â†’ Validation â†’ MongoDB"
